# California Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview

**Link to live website**: [California Housing Price Prediction](#)

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California based on various features such as the location, median income, and housing characteristics. The machine learning model aims to predict the median house value using a dataset with information about California's housing.

## Dataset Content

The dataset consists of information about housing in California. It includes various features such as:
- Longitude and latitude
- Median house value
- Number of rooms and bedrooms
- Population and households
- Median income, etc.

This dataset is sourced from a public dataset and is split into training, validation, and test sets for model development.

## Business Requirements

As data analysts from Code institute, i was tasked with developing a predictive model that can accurately estimate housing prices based on the dataset provided. The business requirements include:
1. **Data Analysis**: Understand key features affecting housing prices.
2. **Prediction Model**: Develop a machine learning model that can predict housing prices.
3. **Dashboard**: Create a dashboard that enables users to interact with the model and test predictions.

## Hypothesis and Validation

- **Hypothesis**: The features such as median income and number of rooms have a significant impact on housing prices.
- **Validation**: We will train a model using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature analysis and a regression model for price prediction. We will compare the model's performance with and without augmented data.
  
### Hypothesis Testing:
1. **Hypothesis 1**: Higher median income results in higher housing prices.
2. **Hypothesis 2**: The number of rooms and bedrooms is positively correlated with the house price.

### Model Validation:
- The model will first be tested with a baseline approach, followed by the use of higher-quality images (features) for training.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters will be conducted to optimize the performance.

## Rationale for Mapping Business Requirements to ML Tasks

### Business Requirement 1: Data Visualization
As a client, we want to access detailed data analysis to better understand the factors influencing housing prices.

- We will design a **Streamlit Dashboard** to showcase visualizations, including scatter plots, correlations, and distributions of key features.
- **Key Visualizations**:
  - Display the average price distribution across geographical regions.
  - Analyze the relationship between income levels and house prices.
  - Show a heatmap of correlations among various features.

### Business Requirement 2: Classification
As a client, we need to predict housing prices using an ML model based on the given dataset.

- We will develop a model to predict housing prices based on inputs like median income, number of rooms, and other features.
- A regression model will be created using **XGBoost** or **Linear Regression** and tested on both training and validation datasets.

## Model Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: The model should predict the median house price with an accuracy of at least 80% on the test set.
- **Metrics**: 
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-squared (RÂ²)

The model will output the predicted house price along with the probability for each prediction.
